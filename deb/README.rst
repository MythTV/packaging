=====
Debian & Ubuntu Packaging (.deb)
=====

The deb packaging directory contains two scripts "build-debs.sh" and
"build-dsc.sh".

 - Invoking "build-debs.sh" will install all prerequisites and build
   binary .deb packages that could be directly installed.
 - Invoking "build-dsc.sh" will install prerequisites for building a
   source package (.dsc) that can then be built using pbuilder, sbuild
   Launchpad, dpkg-buildpackage, debuild or a similar tool.
   Use this if you don't want to install all build dependencies on
   your local box and have a remote builder box.

Usage
-----
./build-debs.sh [git_branch] [target_dir] [additional_patches]

	git_branch -> optional: the GIT branch of MythTV to build

	target_dir -> optional: the dir used for the & GIT checkouts

	additional_patches -> optional: space separated full path to all patches to apply

If the target_dir already contains git checkouts, they
will just be updated to the latest HEAD followed by the git
checkout being checked out to the branch indicated.

Examples:
 - ./build-debs.sh
	This would check out the branch matching packaging branch name and build debs in `pwd`
 - ./build-debs.sh fixes/0.27 /tmp
	This would checkout out the fixes/0.27 branch, local packaging and build debs in /tmp
 - ./build-debs.sh fixes/0.27 /tmp /full/path/to/patch
	This would checkout the fixes/0.27 branch, local packaging, apply the patch called
	'patch' located at /full/path/to/ to the build and then produce debs
 - DEBUILD_FLAGS='-sa' ./build-dsc.sh fixes/0.27 /tmp /full/path/to/patch
	This would build source packages (that could be later built somewhere such as
	launchpad PPA's) from the 0.27 fixes branch, in the tmp directory, while
	apply the patch /full/path/to/patch
 - DEBIAN_SUFFIX='0ubuntu4' DEBUILD_FLAGS='-sa' ./build-dsc.sh fixes/0.27 /tmp /full/path/to/patch
	This would build source packages (that could be later built somewhere such as
	launchpad PPA's) from the 0.27 fixes branch, in the tmp directory, while
	apply the patch /full/path/to/patch. It would also force the debian suffix
        '0ubuntu4' in the version rather than default to '0ubuntu1'
 - UBUNTU_RELEASE='wily' DEBIAN_SUFFIX='0ubuntu3' DEBUILD_FLAGS='-sa' ./build-dsc.sh fixes/0.27 /tmp /full/path/to/patch
	This would build source packages (that could be later built somewhere such as
	launchpad PPA's) from the 0.27 fixes branch, in the tmp directory, while
	apply the patch /full/path/to/patch for Ubuntu Wily. It would also force the
        debian suffix '0ubuntu3' (in case of multiple builds in a single day)
 - DEBFULLNAME='NAME HERE' DEBEMAIL='user@example.com' UBUNTU_RELEASE='bionic' DEBIAN_SUFFIX='0ubuntu2' ./build-dsc.sh fixes/29 /tmp
	This would build source packages (that could be later built somewhere such as
	launchpad PPA's) from the fixes/29 branch, in the tmp directory. It would
        also force the debian suffix '0ubuntu1'. However, it will not sign the source
        ackages, so they will need to be signed later (using 'debsign' for
        ser@example.com) prior to uploading them to the Ubuntu repository.
