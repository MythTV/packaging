    rating if the user cannot see the changes made is sound, however
    making it so that we check if the buttonlist is displaying the

  * [57687c8] Subtitles: Initialize the SRT error count to avoid bogus
    diagnostics.

    this timeout was to prevent a very delayed response to an
    availability check causing playlists to resume playing long after
    the user had moved on. The present timeout was very short though and
    didn't account for delays caused by disks needing to be spun up or

    it remains hidden behind the poster.
  * [fbba2ae] Show coverart in the Terra OSD, falling back to channel
    icon if the artwork isn't available and channel number if the
    channel icon isn't available.
  * [ff4d601] DVD navigation: Reenable skipping past the last chapter of
    a title, and skipping previous to the first chapter of a title.  The
    limitation may have been left over from an older version of
    libdvdnav.
  * [8ea557a] Fix 'depends'. I'm surprised I didn't notice this earlier,
    perhaps because I was using <group> a lot I missed that depends
    behaviour didn't work for immediate children of <window>.
  * [eb87f9e] Fix 'depends' for inherited and copied screens.
  * [38221b8] Only show poster in the default-wide OSD when we're not

    it.

  * [6bfda0c] Fix mythoneminder compilation when using mysql universal
    libraries.
  * [21ad34b] Add --firewire-sdk configuration switch to configure

  * [7e4740e] Refs #8941. Make sure we set the channum when switching to
    a new card with either a specific chanid or inputid.
  * [05bc5e1] plugins configure: Remove some debugging left by mistake
  * [ff593fa] Clean up the mappings for network control jump points.

  * [6f24f3b] Subtitles: Rename the OSDSubFont setting to
    DefaultSubtitleFont.
  * [6202c0d] Revert "Subtitles: Remove the OSDSubFont setting."
  * [4a2420e] MythZoneMinder: Add support for the deep filesystem
    hierarchy for events.
  * [a6b1e3a] Program editor: don't seek too far when stepping to the
    next keyframe.
  * [97da8c8] Fix a doxygen comment
  * [144c8bb] MythMusic: Do a full reload of the tracks and playlists
    after doing a scan
  * [f78f999] Change delete behaviour so that we always use the deleted
    recording group allowing all recordings to be undeleted. By default
    we will only keep recordings for a minimum of 5 minutes (max ~20m)
    after their deletion, enough time to recover from a mistake but
    still free up space quickly. As before the user can specify to keep
    deleted recordings for a fixed number of days or until the space is
    needed for a new recording instead. Post 0.25 this change will allow
    us to strip out the old deletion code and simplify configuration
    process, the functional change is being made now to fix a couple of
    bugs caused by external processes such as MythPreviewGen blocking
    deletes from the UI. Fixes #9536
  * [cfd3fc0] MythMusic: Fix the sending of the MUSIC_SETTINGS_CHANGED
    event
  * [5932419] Merge branch 'compartist'
  * [5206271] Subtitles: Apply OSDCC708TextZoom to CEA-608 captions as
    well.
  * [99512fb] Refs #10386.  Don't sent EXIT_TO_MAIN event to Live TV
    jump point.
  * [dfd909f] Fix crash on mac when no audio device exists.
  * [bd68156] MythMusic: Fix the BLANKSCR keybinding not working
  * [9016890] MythMusic: Check for some additional cdio headers
  * [3570a99] MythMusic: Fix a memory leak in the playlist editor
  * [7e6f5fa] Fixes #10386. Segfault fix. Check for null.
  * [510da69] As noted in SHA1:9551bce2, MainServer doesn't know the
    actual recording status because it defaults to rsRecorded when the
    recordinginfo is initialized from the recorded table.  MainServer
    doesn't account for this and tries to make any needed state change
    which always ends up staying rsRecorded.  MainServer then passes
    this bad status to the scheduler.  If the recording had already
    failed, the rsFailed status gets overwritten.
  * [3740d7d] Spelling consistency fixes
  * [47d7c77] Fixes #9233. Refs #7408. Re-enables WindowResized().
  * [a5447f1] MythMusic: Add a Compilations branch to the playlist
    editor
  * [1824969] Fixes #10153. Guess at DVB-S vs DVB-S2 when not explicitly
    set.
  * [21784ce] Fixes #10377. Prevent getting "stuck on a mux".
  * [593d24b] Refs #10377. Some logging fixes. (VB_PLAYBACK-
    >VB_CHANNEL).
  * [14ec737] Change the rsTuning UI state equivalent from 'tuning' to
    'running'. The UI states for the 'status' statetype are limited to 5
    generic values (normal, running, warning, error, disabled) to allow
    some portability to scenarios other than recording. (This was
    supposed to save themers some time and effort although it also binds
    their hands and doesn't allow as much creativity with how various
    recording states are represented. For this reason it may be re-
    visited post-0.25)
  * [4d68d5e] Updated Russian MythFrontend, MythArchive, MythBrowser,
    MythGallery, MythGame, MythMusic, MythNews, MythWeather and
    MythZoneminder.
  * [34c8767] Subtitles: fix an incorrect CEA-708 font mapping.
  * [b967448] Fix the faulty exit code 139 issue in Ubuntu systems
  * [723d798] Subtitles: improve vertical alignment for CEA-608
    captions.
  * [1af1aec] Fixes display of position in the Program Lister.
    MythUIButtonList is zero indexed, to get a position for display we
    must add one.
  * [967208b] Fix the last, hopefully, remaining places where
    livetvorder isn't honored.
  * [0a301c0] Fix the scheduler to not write incorrect oldrecorded
    entries.
  * [5d5aef3] Subtitles: improve the layout.
  * [878d5eb] String consistency updated
  * [456bb42] Updated Estonian MythFrontend and all plugins translation
    from Marko Punnar
  * [e719d54] Replace tabs with spaces in Terra's schedule filter editor
    window xml
  * [a3d9891] Use proper capitalization for some common words and
    prefixes.
  * [5b19c4d] Populate the infomap from both RecordingRule and
    RecordingInfo if available. This fixes recording rule specific
    information not being available in the sub screens of the schedule
    editor.
  * [f77d001] Fix minor problems editing in-progress recordings.
  * [006ded1] Fix recording status strings being set to 'Not scheduled'
    when the reason for that is they were in the past and should have
    been marked as Recorded/Aborted/Failed/Cancelled/etc instead
  * [6bedf81] Correct handling of unrelated argument after arg-less
    keyword.
  * [7adbd54] Delay String processing until after QApplication has been
    initialized.
  * [f613a43] Fix LiveTV switching by videosource to honor livetvorder.
  * [9b5b7b5] Exit cutlist edit mode cleanly when executing a jump
    point.
  * [c2a0b85] Updated British English translation MythFrontend
    translation from Nick Morrott.
  * [307dac8] Make jump points work during playback when the OSD is
    present.
  * [d59f4f4] Change dynamic cast to static. This is troubling because
    we rely on dynamic casts in so many places but for at least one
    person this cast was failing and causing popup menus in MythMusic to
    no longer have any effect. Maybe a buggy version of gcc?
  * [3de87c3] Subtitles: Fix a logic error.
  * [23d5167] Make host checks in Video Library scanner case
    insensitive.
  * [5d7c01d] Cutlist editor: Update the edit bar for in-progress
    recordings.
  * [1ce3d21] Cutlist editor: Adjust "Cut to End" behavior for an in-
    progress recording.
  * [4a8546d] Merge branch 'master' of github.com:MythTV/mythtv
  * [1d6485d] MythArchive consistency fixes.
  * [89c34ef] Fix seeking backwards into a cut region.
  * [6c3b564] Updated British English translation MythFrontend
    translation from Nick Morrott.
  * [5501fff] Fix long-standing bug that always cleared
    record.next_record instead of updating it.
  * [0c5de8e] Add missing menu closed event when closing the menu via
    the mouse. Fixes the menu dialog not working in some screens after
    being dismissed using a right click.
  * [93c228d] Prevent crash when invoking the menu dialog via the right
    mouse button in Watch Recordings. ShowMenu() is a virtual method in
    MythScreenType, it's intended purpose is to load/display the context
    menu but here it is displaying a menu loaded elsewhere with no
    guards against duplicate popups being created. Move the menu display
    code to DisplayPopupMenu(), restore ShowMenu() to behave the same as
    the MENU key binding and re-instate the guards against multiple menu
    dialogs being created. Also fixes #10248 - 'Cannot delete recording
    if file is missing'
  * [b755eca] Attempt to prevent a QString segfault if MythMenu changes
    while a dialog is open.
  * [f3efafe] Fix segfault in MythUIButtonTree when list is empty and we
    attempt to navigate it. Refs #9101
  * [b3e44a2] Rule type was missed from the RecordingRule text map.
    Added so that it appears twice in the map, once under the correct
    title of ruletype but also as rectype to be consistent with the
    ProgramInfo map until after 0.25 when we can rename that instance.
  * [2075458] Remove deprecated attribute from dispatchNow(), we know
    it's deprecated but it's not going anywhere soon.
  * [82fc1af] Add Collection support to developmental tmdb3 grabber.
  * [0f0b0a7] Better backend metaclass, and people search support.
  * [c47940a] Clean up and document background machinery
  * [850fbc2] Replacement PagedList to temporarily work around bug in
    search API
  * [d13addf] Add caching to tmdbv3 requests.
  * [fe97f23] In progress TMDB v3 grabber script.

  * >>Upstream changes since last upload (769dfae):
  * [532cee8] Fix mouse support with groups. The code made bad
    assumptions but just happened to work in the past because focusable
    widgets were always no more than one level down.
  * [8cbd24a] Silence gcc warning about an unused variable in
    myththemedmenu.cpp
  * [5f5e015] Fix bug caught by Daniel, variable 'selected' was set but
    never used.

  * [ef62f60] Fix minor typo
  * [1ed8ec2] MythUI: Fix scrolling with the mouse in MythUIWebBrowser
  * [d07bf50] Fix the AVC HD icon in PBB. I think this was disabled at
    the beginning because some themers wanted to prefer the states
    showing HD resolution 1080/720 over the state which just indicates
    codec and definition. However the code is written such that leaving
    the state out of the theme means that we fall back to the next
    matching state, so themers shouldn't see any difference if they
    don't define the avchd state.
  * [2c712c8] Updated Greek MythFrontend, MythArchive, MythBrowser,
    MythGallery, MythMusic, MythNetvision, MythNews and MythWeather
    translation from Yianni Vidalis

  * [a186aa0] Fix a small typo in MythGallery.
  * [8db7c05] Leave the start/endyear strings empty if the year matches
    the current. A temporary workaround which provides the behaviour
    people want without risking breakage of existing themes, of course
    it won't fix existing themes either. It only works for ProgramInfo
    templated dates so won't be consistent across the UI. It also
    doesn't work for users with years in the long-date formats, since
    the year will be shown twice.
  * [148314b] Subtitles: Try to ensure CEA-708 subtitles stay within the
    safe area.
  * [e44d341] I either misunderstood Daniel or he changed his mind.
  * [fe42d2d] Add year to all 'long' form date strings from PI. After
    discussing it with Daniel in IRC it was decided not to wait until
    0.26 to fix this properly. As implemented the year will only be
    added to the strings if the date falls outside the current year.

    before.
  * [1f6d42e] Convert some case insensitive QString checks to use
    compare().
  * [f53a00f] Fix videos not being marked as watched. We had some code
    to handle in-progress recordings where we didn't have the total
    number of frames, this used the start/end time of the recording
    which can't be trusted for video because they are based on the
    length from downloaded metadata e.g. An episode of Frasier might
    only be 22 minutes long without adverts but according to the
    metadata it's 30 minutes. We now trust the totalFrames to be
    accurate for anything which isn't an in-progress recording.

    and video playback length. LiveTV is already correct since it uses
    the actual recording times but in-progress recordings still uses
    frames written and fps which is obviously wrong for variable
    framerate and repeat frame material. The problem with in-progress

  * in the git building rule, make sure to include the proper phrases
    for autobuilds.
  * reverse the rule for do-new-release.sh
  * include a data directory to fix mythweb postinst breaking.
  * New upstream checkout (1405782)
  * >>Upstream changes since last upload (d3d2640):

  * [588cc6e] Fix potential deadlocks resulting in "Waited 100ms for
    video buffers"

    Add a little bit of leeway when checking the alsa buffer size, as
    alsa may round down the value.
  * [8115c44] Tidy up the block processing in AddFrames by renaming
    variables. Block size is properly calculated based on the source
    channels. Properly cast all variables involved in 64 bits timecode
    calculation as int64_t, and make all constants long long ones. Make
    the code easier to re-read
  * [1b695d7] Issue we were trying to fix in SHA:
    312ef27cd0d5a8b515cf0ba2587bdc2ba94aac28 were in fact related to the
    alsa hardware buffer size being too low. And the calculation for
    what the correct buffer size should be being incorrect, we never got
    the proper value displayed/set. For 5.1 32 bits LPCM, 48kHz a
    minimum buffer size should be 225kB. Alsa default is 64kB
  * [3a0bc28] Simplify upmixing and fix some issues, in particular
    timestamp that could be incorrect under some circumstances, fix
    writing silence to the audio card when in pause mode (we could under
    some circumstances not write enough data leading to underruns
  * [cfd7b78] Remove the state change QWaitCondition from the TV class.
  * [3e29dab] Left justify CC-608 captions.
  * [6bb60cd] Minor CC-608 caption display optimisation.
  * [7b4f3fb] Don't create an additional thread for media playback.

    fixed this properly in r19250.

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * debian/mythtv-database.postinst:
    - Don't reset the backend IPs unless you
      are loading a database
    - Pre-set mythbuntu theme.  If mythbuntu theme isn't
      around, G.A.N.T. gets loaded instead, so no expected
      regresssions.
  * debian/mythtv-database.config:
    - Try to get answer from mysql-server config if possible
      this avoids asking admin pass question twice.
    - Check if mysql binary is around before repeatedly
      asking questions.
   - Check if localhost that mysqld is running.  If it's
      not, then don't keep asking questions.

    - Don't restart mythtv-backend on upgrade of packages.
      Unexpected behavior might happen depending on what other packages
      are installed at that time and what will still be installed.
      The common use case for a problem here is dist-upgrades.
      (LP: #298914)
  * Store .sh and .d files as non executable in bzr to better reflect
    flat packaging as seen in the archive.
  * debian/patches/24_fix_h264_frame_counting.dpatch:
    - Remove .orig file from the patch as it's unnecessary (LP: #311549)

      fail the postinst in this case. (LP: #299352)

    (too many complaints about "broken" packages caused by old libraries and
     binaries)

mythtv (0.8-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean /var/log/mythtv on purge of mythtv-backend
  * Clarify the debconf note which explains about running setup, so that
    it includes a note about X and explains how to start the backend
    afterward.
  * Clarify package descriptions to explain their relationships
  * Raise the priority of the question about the mysql admin password to
    'high', and add some additional info to it.  There is a dilemma here
    between confusing users by asking this question (when they have not
    set a password), and confusing them by skipping it (when the user has
    set a password)
  * Move the dependency on the Qt mysql module to libmyth-0.8 where it is
    shared by all packages which depend on it
