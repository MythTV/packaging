Description: Personal video recorder application (client and server)
 MythTV implements the following PVR features, and more, with a
 unified graphical interface:
 .
  - Basic 'live-tv' functionality. Pause/Fast Forward/Rewind "live" TV.
  - Video compression using RTjpeg or MPEG-4
  - Program listing retrieval using XMLTV
  - Themable, semi-transparent on-screen display
  - Electronic program guide
  - Scheduled recording of TV programs
  - Resolution of conflicts between scheduled recordings
  - Basic video editing
 .
 http://www.mythtv.org/
 .
 This package will install a complete MythTV client/server environment on a
 single system.  If you are intended on using this as your only MythTV machine,
 and this machine is already configured as a desktop, this package will get you
 up and running switfly.
 .
 If you are intended on installing this on a standalone/non-desktop machine,
 you should look into the Metapackages available:
 mythtv-backend-master (backend with a local database)
 mythtv-backend (backend needing a remote database)

Description: create and burn DVD's from MythTV - binary file
 MythArchive is a plugin for MythTV that lets you create DVDs from your
 recorded shows, files and any video files available on your
 system. It can also archive recordings in a proprietary format that
 archives not only the file but also all the associated metadata like title,
 description and cut list information which will mean you can create backups
 of myth recordings which can later be restored or it will also allow you to
 move recordings between myth systems without losing any of the metadata. It
 is a complete rewrite of the old MythBurn bash scripts, now using Python,
 and the mythfrontend UI plugin.
