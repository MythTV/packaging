 This package will install a complete MythTV client/server environment on a
 single system.  If you are intended on using this as your only MythTV machine,
 and this machine is already configured as a desktop, this package will get you
 up and running switfly.
 .
 If you are intended on installing this on a standalone/non-desktop machine,
 you should look into the metapackages available:
 mythtv-backend-master (backend with a local database)
 mythtv-backend (backend needing a remote database)

Depends: ntp | time-daemon | ntp-simple, mythtv-database (= ${source:Version}), mythtv-backend (= ${source:Version})
Recommends: mythweb
Description: Metapackage to setup and configure a "Master Backend" profile of MythTV.
 This package will install and configure all necessary packages for this machine
 to behave as a "Master" Backend for a mythtv network.  This package is intended to
 be installed on the machine that will behave as the first (and possibly only)
 backend for the network.  Typically, this package will be installed on a server rather then a desktop.
 It makes no sense to install it on anything but the first backend machine on the network.
