Description: A personal video recorder application (client and server)
 MythTV implements the following PVR features, and more, with a
 unified graphical interface:
 .
  - Basic 'live-tv' functionality. Pause/Fast Forward/Rewind "live" TV.
  - Video compression using RTjpeg or MPEG-4
  - Program listing retrieval using XMLTV
  - Themable, semi-transparent on-screen display
  - Electronic program guide
  - Scheduled recording of TV programs
  - Resolution of conflicts between scheduled recordings
