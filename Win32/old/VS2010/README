Visual Studio 2010 solution for MythTV

The files located in this repository allow you to compile mythbackend using
Visual Studio 2010.  

This undertaking was done solely to allow the VS2010 debugger to be used to 
develop for the backend.  Although mythbackend and mythfrontend compile and 
run, there still is missing functionality such as recorder support (although 
hdhomerun might not be that difficult to get working).

Also note, that ffmpeg related files can't be compiled natively in VS2010 
and that this solution expects you to build/locate MinWG built dll's for those
dependencies.  (look to thirdparty/ffmpeg/README for details)

A few things to note:

  * So far, it can only compile the following projects:

        libmyth
        libmythbase
        libfreemheg
        libmythfreesurround
        libmythmetadata
        libmythsamplerate
        libmythservicecontracts
        libmythsoundtouch
        libmythtv
        libmythui
        libmythupnp

        mythbackend
        mythfilldatabase
        mythfrontend
        mythtv-setup
        
  * I'm using the 4.8.0 version of Qt Library for VS2010 which can be 
    downloaded and installed from: http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

        "Qt libraries 4.8.0 for Windows (VS 2010, 275 MB)"

    NOTE: You may need to build the Qt MySql plugin manually.

  * This solution has been setup so that the MythTV source and this VS2010 
    repository remain in a separate directory tree and/or drive.  It uses
    a .props file to specify the MythTV source location.

    NOTE:  Edit the following .props files _before_ opening the VS2010.sln
           file.

    You will need to edit the "mythtv.props" file to point the mythtv_source
    UserMacro at the location of the source code.  Ensure that you specify the
    top-level of the hierarchy, meaning that there are subdirectories for
    mythplugins, mythtv, themestringtool, etc.

    Here is a snippet from the .props file that needs to be changed.

      <PropertyGroup Label="UserMacros">
        <mythtv_source>y:\git\mythtv\mythtv</mythtv_source>
      </PropertyGroup>

  * You will need to update the "Qt4VSPropertySheet.props" file to make sure
    the QTDIR value is set correctly.  
    
    NOTE: I also defined the QTDIR environment variable just in case, but it 
          should not be needed.

  * Run version.vbs to create version.h, which is a file normally generated
    during the build process in Unix (You will need to edit the file to point
    it to the correct path)

  * The avconfig.h file is generated during the Linux configure, so move it
    to mythtv/external/FFmpeg/libavutil

  * I tried to limit the impact to the base MythTV source, so I create any
    unix-only header files that were included and they are located in the
    "compat" directory.

  * Any third party library that is needed has a directory under the
    "thirdparty" directory.  You will need to look at each folder's README
    file to determine where/what is needed.

  * Install the MySQL connector for C
    (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/)

  * Edit copydll.vbs and update the directories.

  * Run copydll.vbs to copy various .dll's from thirdparty and other
    locations into bin\debug.

  * MythTV's version of ffmpeg still needs to be compiled using MingW and
    import libraries need to be manually created (see README file).
