You need to place all myth specific ffmpeg DLL's here.  

  libmythavformat.dll
  libmythavutil.dll
  libmythavcore.dll
  libmythavcodec.dll

They will need to be built using MingW, or can be found prebuilt online.

You will need to create import libraries for each dll.

******
The following taken from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/131313

Given a .DLL with functions exported via a C interface, you can create an 
import library by following these steps: 

  * Use DUMPBIN /EXPORTS <.DLL file name> to obtain the list of exported 
    symbols for the .DLL in question.  The symbols appear in the "name" 
    column of the table whose headings are "ordinal hint name." 

  * Create a .DEF file that contains an EXPORTS section with the names of 
    the functions listed in the "name" column of the DUMPBIN output.  For 
    _cdecl functions, the symbol appears just as it would when used in the 
    calling program. Just place this symbol in the EXPORTS section of the 
    .DEF file. 

  * Use LIB /DEF:<.DEF file name> to generate the import library and exports 
    file. The base name of the import library will be the base name of the 
    .DEF file. Use /OUT: to control the output library name.

-=>NOTE: I have included the .DEF files I used, however they may not be correct 
         and should be generated based on the actual DLL's used.
